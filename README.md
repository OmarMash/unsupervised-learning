# Wholesale Dataset - Unsupervised Learning Project

This unsupervised learning project aims to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together.
We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.
